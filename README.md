The project involves feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and comparative analysis of the selected models based on key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 
The integration of XAI allows not only a thorough evaluation of model performance but also an in-depth understanding of feature importance in identifying malicious activities.
